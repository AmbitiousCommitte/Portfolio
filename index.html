        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my little space! My name is Tony, initally Thien which means Sky in Vietnamese. I am a student at University of South Florida who passionates with coding and soccer (Not really related right? I know but they are a fun combination). I am currently based in Tampa, Florida but my hometown is at Ho Chi Minhcity in Vietnam. I have been in the US for 3 years, from the mini fridge Minnesota, to the hot and cold Washington State, and now a real life furnace, Flordia. No matter how different the weather are, one thing you will recognize, TONY IS HERE AND HE WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY. My lfie is still long and "tough", and in this journey of finding happiness I would say, I hope to meet you guys, wonderful people and build connection togethers. I would love to make projects with you guys too. Thanks for heading over.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you curious more about my coding journey, here is a little split. My coding journey begins my first year in the IB, when I took IB Computer Science SL. It was hard, it was so damn hard, I mean the debugging part you know, lately, I started to fell in love with it. Over the years, I have trainer my skills in not only coding, but also in communication, critical thinking, problem solving and collaboration, the 4 most important skills not only in this field, or in any field or in our life, in my opinion (of course). Using Python, I got to collaborated and worked on various exciting projects. Coding is fun, really fun, and I thrive on challenges that I met. Sometimes, it is really boring and discouraged, but keep going, because you will get there and get to showcase your beautiful and majestic work. Enjoy the process, and the result will come to you. That is my mindset, and I hope you have it also.</p>
